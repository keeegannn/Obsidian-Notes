If it is required to relate a frequency to radians per second, or to Hertz, then the frequency should be scaled by ∆t, or ∆t / 2π respectively where ∆t is the sampling interval measured in seconds. Thus, a sampled signal that is periodic in the time domain has a frequency domain representation that is periodic and sampled. If it is assumed that the time domain signal has a period of N samples, then the spacing of samples in the frequency domain is 2π / N radians.
