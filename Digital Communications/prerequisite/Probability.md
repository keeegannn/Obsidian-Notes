To describe the relation between random variables a joint probability of random variables X and Y in set curly f

The joint moment 
![[Pasted image 20240918223321.png]]
for any n and m
Note that two RVs are independent if only if the joint distribution of them is the product of the marginal PDFs
![[Pasted image 20240918223544.png]]
Recall that independence always implies uncorrelation, but not the other way.

## Uniform Distribution
Curly U is used to describe uniform distributions

## Gaussian Distribution

![[Pasted image 20240918224144.png]]
## Error Function
the error function is the CDF of the gaussian distribution
![[Pasted image 20240918224159.png]]
where tau is the function variable x for example we need to normalize before using the CDF
## Central Limit Theorem
adding sufficiently large number of independent RVs will give a Gaussian distribution.
## Q-Function
![[Pasted image 20240918224624.png]]
## Rayleigh Distribution 
is related to the normal standard distribution and a Rayleigh RV is shown by R = $\sqrt{ X^2+Y^2}$ where X = Y = N(1,0) and are independent
