## White Noise
An additive white Gaussian noise n(t) with N0 /2 double-  
sided variance is defined as a RP that has Rn (t) = N0  
2 d (t) and thus a constant PSD as G n ( f ) = N0 /2. n(t) is added to  
signals as distortion and any sample of the noise n(t1 ) follows a mean-zero Gaussian distribution. The fact that Rn (t) is the  
scaled version of a delta function tells us that any two samples of n(t) (e.g., n(t 1 ) and n(t 2 )) are statistically independent  
no matter how close they are taken in time. The noise is therefore called white as its spectrum includes all frequencies  
(i.e., colors) equally.
