A random process (RP) is an extension of a RV where the outcomes of random phenomena is being observed and modelled over time or space and therefore they are mapped to a random function of time or space.

## Harmonic RP

Where $\phi$ and n are random variables
## Stationary RP

### Strict Sense
The joint PDF of X(t) does not change in time

### Wide Sense
Not a function of time However are times are correlated with other times

## Ergodicity
A RP X(t) is ergodic if its moments can be identically calculated by either time average or ensemble average.

for ith element and jth element

## Autocorrelation Function
E (X(t1)X(t2))
tau = t2 - t1 
denoted as R$_{t}$ = E(X(t2 - t1)E(t1))
for real WSS RP X the ACF has the following properties
1. R X (t) is real,  
2. R X (t) is even symmetric, i.e., RX(tau) = RX (-tau),  
3. ACF reaches its maximum at t = 0,  
4. The direct-current (DC) power of a random signal can be described as RX (infinity), and  
5. The alternating-current (AC) power of a random signal can be described as RX (0) - RX (infinty).
## Power Spectral density
1. G X ( f ) is even symmetric,  
2. G X ( f ) is real and positive for all f , and
