The bandwidth of a signal provides a measure of the size of the significant spectral content of the signal in positive frequencies. Due to finite time signals not nessesariy being finite in the frequency domain we use different ways to measure the bandwidth. Find the largest frequency component go 3db and see what frequencies cross it.
