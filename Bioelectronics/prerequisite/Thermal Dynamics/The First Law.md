dU = dQ + dW
dU = change in internal energy of a system
dQ = change in heat of a system
dW = the change in work system
A material can store energy in many ways, for example: by vibrational or rotational  
energy of its molecules, by experiencing force due to an external electric/magnetic  
field, by radiation etc.
If the piston is free to move, and is displaced a small amount (dx) by the force F, then  
the work done by the gas is calculated simply as:  
Work done = F•dx = pA•dx = p•dV. (where dV is the volume of displacement)  
The gas is doing work, so this must be subtracted from the internal energy of the gas  
(U). If dV is positive then there must be a loss in internal energy of the gas  
(conservation of energy). Therefore, the change in internal energy of the gas can be  
defined as:  
dU = dQ – p•dV  
If work were being done on the gas, the volume would be negative (-dV).
“energy is conserved when heat is taken into account”
### Mathematical Analysis

#### Constant Volume Processes

- At constant volume ((dV = 0)), no work is done on or by the system, which simplifies the first law of thermodynamics equation to:dQ=dUdQ=dU
- Here, (dQ) is the heat added, and (dU) is the change in internal energy of the gas.
- The relationship between heat added and temperature increase at constant volume is given by:dQ=Cv×dTdQ=Cv​×dT
- So, you can rewrite the change in internal energy as:dU=Cv×dTdU=Cv​×dT

#### Constant Pressure Processes

- At constant pressure, the system can do work by expanding or contracting. The first law of thermodynamics in this case is:dQ=dU+P×dVdQ=dU+P×dV
- By substituting the expression for (dU) from the constant volume process and using the ideal gas law to express (dV), we get:P×dV=nR×dT(since n and R are constants for a given amount of gas)P×dV=nR×dT(since n and R are constants for a given amount of gas)
- Substituting this into the first law equation for a constant pressure process, we obtain:dQ=Cv×dT+P×dV=Cv×dT+nR×dTdQ=Cv​×dT+P×dV=Cv​×dT+nR×dT
- Factoring out (dT), the heat added at constant pressure becomes:dQ=(Cv+nR)×dTdQ=(Cv​+nR)×dT
- Since (C_p = \frac{dQ}{dT}) at constant pressure, we see that:Cp=Cv+nRCp​=Cv​+nR

#### Understanding (C_p) and (C_v)

- From these formulas, it’s evident that (C_p) is always greater than (C_v) for an ideal gas because (nR) (where (R) is a positive number) represents the work done by the system during expansion at constant pressure. This additional term in the (C_p) equation accounts for the energy needed not only to raise the temperature of the gas but also to allow for its expansion against atmospheric pressure.

This mathematical treatment provides a powerful tool for understanding the thermodynamic behaviors of gases and is critical for designing and operating various mechanical and chemical systems.
