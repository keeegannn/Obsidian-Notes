An objective  
definition of hotness concerns the direction of heat flow. If A is hotter than B then we  
mean that, if the two systems are brought into thermal contact, heat flows of its own  
accord from A to B and not in the other direction. This certainly agrees with our  
physiological definitionâ€”we get hot or burnt in contact with a hot object.
