A fatty acid molecule thus has two chemically distinct parts â€“ a long hydrophobic  
chain that is not very reactive chemically, and a carboxyl group (COOH) which when  
ionized as COO- is chemically active and hydrophilic.
Molecules such as these,  
which contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, are termed amphipathic.![[Pasted image 20240916210444.png]]
