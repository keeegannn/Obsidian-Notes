Amino acids are monomers  that make up polymeric chains of proteins. there are 20 types of amino acids all but proline contain the amino group NH$_{2}$ and a carboxyl  group COOH. at normal Ph levels  we get NH$_{3}$$^+$

In neutral solutions (pH » 7) amino acids exist predominantly in the dipolar, doubly  
ionized form, called a zwitterion. The central carbon is called the alpha-carbon and is
bonded to the amino group, a carboxyl group and a hydrogen atom R gives the characteristic 
of the amino acid. Only the L forms of amino acids are found in proteins,  the D forms can be found in bacterial cell walls and antibiotics.
The chemical structures of the 20 common amino acids are given in Tables 2.1 - 2.3,  
and are classified according to whether their side chain is hydrophilic or hydrophobic.

whether a side chain is hydrophobic or hydrophilic are:  
• Carbon and nonpolar groups do not readily hydrogen-bond to water, and are thus  
hydrophobic,  
• Oxygen and nitrogen can H-bond to water, and are thus hydrophilic.  
• Ionizable groups (e.g., –COO-, –NH3+ or =NH2+) are hydrophilic.  
• Polar groups are hydrophilic.
A covalent chemical bond can be formed between two amino acids to form a  
dipeptide, involving the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of the  
other. This bond, known as a peptide bond, results from the elimination of a molecule  
of water in a so-called condensation reaction:

The carboxyl and nitrogen atom forming the peptide bond between the two amino acids 
residues exhibit a resonating partial double-bond character.

Because of this resonance bonding, the six atoms of the peptide group (the two alpha-  
carbons, the carbon, oxygen and nitrogen plus hydrogen) all lie in the same plane, as  
shown in Figure 2.6. Independent rotation of two planar peptide groups about their  
connecting alpha-carbon is possible. As shown in Figure 2.7, the relative  
conformation of a pair of planar peptide groups can be defined by two dihedral angles  
j and f, where j is the angle of rotation about the Ca-C bond, and f is the angle of  
rotation about the N-Ca bond.

Figure 2.8 for valine and isoleucine, and the  
allowed values for j and f for glycine occupy all four quadrants of the Ramachandron  
plot and permit a broad range of conformations. With increasing length and  
complexity of the side chain R, the degree of steric freedom becomes increasingly  
smaller.
