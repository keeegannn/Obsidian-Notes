Proteins are the working molecules of cells. They provide a cell with structural  
rigidity; pumps to drive ions and metabolites across membranes; catalysts for a vast  
range of biochemical reactions including the functioning of genes; and ‘motors’ to  
provide motility of objects within cells and of some whole cells.
proteins are largely composed of Carbon Hydrogen Oxygen C$_{400}$H$_{620}$N$_{100}$O$_{120}$P$_{1}$ for example
when a protein is dissolved it was found to be composed of [[Amino Acids]]

## prosthetic groups
Some proteins, known as conjugated proteins, contain chemical components that are  
not amino acid residues. These components, known as prosthetic groups, are held in  
place in the protein structure through interactions with peptide unit side chains.  
Metalloproteins contain complexes that incorporate metals such as zinc, calcium and  
copper, and haemoglobin contains an iron complex known as a haem or porphyrin  
group. Casein found in milk contains a phosphate group, and is an example of a  
phosphoprotein. The lipoproteins found in blood contain lipids, and glycoproteins  
contain carbohydrates, of which the immunoglobulin antibody is a good example.

## proteomics

For specified conditions and physiological state of a cell, its complete set of proteins  
is known as its proteome, whose study and application is given the name proteomics  
(rather like genomics for the study of genes). Proteomics includes determinations of:  
the dynamics and structure of proteins; their abundance (expression) and localization  
in a cell; chemical modifications of proteins after their translation from mRNA, and
the extent and types of protein-protein interactions.

## Cell Signalling 
The ability of cells to perceive and  
correctly respond to their microenvironment is the basis of their development, tissue  
repair, immunity, and the regulation of their internal environment to maintain a stable  
and constant physiological state (homeostasis). Errors in cell signalling can result in  
various diseases, including cancer and diabetes, and by understanding this diseases  
may be treated effectively.
