The two information-storing molecules in cells are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and  
ribonucleic acid (RNA). Proteins are polymers constructed from 20 different  
monomers (the amino acids) but DNA and RNA are comprised of just four monomers  
– called nucleotides. A nucleotide is composed of a phosphate group and a ‘base’  
linked together by a five-carbon sugar molecule (pentose). The bases found in DNA  
are adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine, often abbreviated as A, G, C and T. In  
RNA the thymine base (T) is replaced by uracil (U). In DNA the pentose sugar  
molecule is deoxyribose, whereas in RNA it is ribose.

## DNA
Nucleic acids consist of polymer chains of nucleotides, formed in a  
condensation reaction to create a phosphodiester bond - in which, as shown in Figure  
2.12, a water molecule is released (as with the production of a glycosidic bond  
between sugars or a peptide bond between amino acids). Two nucleotides joined by  
such a bond forms a dinucleotide, and a trinucleotide represents a single strand of  
DNA containing three nucleotides. Additional nucleotides can be added to produce a  
long DNA single strand having a defined chemical orientation. One end (the so-  
called 3’ end) of a DNA strand has a free hydroxyl group (attached to carbon 3 of the  
sugar), whilst the other end (the 5’end) has a phosphate group. This orientation has  
important implications regarding the properties of DNA.

To assist in the packaging of this DNA into the nucleus of a human cell it is wrapped  
around protein molecules, called histones, to form structural units called nucleosomes  
that are spaced at regular intervals along the main DNA chain – rather like beads on a  
string. Arrays of nucleosomes form chromatin fibres that are then further packaged  
into chromosomes only in eukaryotic cells.

A gene corresponds to a stretch of DNA  
that contains the sequential information for the production of proteins or RNA chains  
that have functional roles in the cell. The entirety of the genes and non-coding  
sequences of DNA in a cell is called its genome.
## RNA
Different types of RNA are central to the synthesis of proteins and are transcribed  
from DNA by enzymes called RNA polymerases.hese enzymes bind to the DNA in  
the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, separate the two strands of the nuclear DNA, and pair  
ribonucleotide bases to the template DNA strand according to the Watson-Crick base-  
pairing interactions shown in Figure 2.14 (with uracil replacing thymine). Thus,  
referring to the replication of a DNA molecule depicted in Figure 2.16, the action of  
RNA polymerase is to produce a strand of RNA with a nucleotide sequence CUGA  
(rather than the sequence CTGA of a DNA strand if DNA polymerase had been in  
action). Many RNA polymerases can act on a single strand of DNA at the same time  
to speed up the transcription process.
