phospholipids composed of two fatty acid side  
chains attached to a negatively charged (and hence hydrophilic) phosphate group via a  
glycerol molecule. The two fatty acid ‘tails’ may both be saturated, unsaturated, or  
adopt one of each form.

Phospholipids can spontaneously form sheets of bilayers, two molecules thick, in an  
aqueous environment. As depicted in Figure 2.2, the hydrocarbon tails keep away  
from the water by aligning themselves in the middle of the bilayer structure. The  
close packing of the hydrocarbon tails is stabilized by van der Waals interactions, and  
the fluidity of the bilayer interior is influenced by the number of C=C double bonds in  
the hydrocarbon structures of the tails. The polar head groups are stabilized through  
hydrogen bonding to water molecules, as well as by electrostatic interactions between  
the phosphate and amine groups. As shown schematically in Figure 2.3 for a fat cell,  
the outer membrane of a cell is formed by a spherical lipid bilayer structure that  
encloses the cytoplasm and internal cell structures.
