Three [[Amino Acids]] can covalently bond together to form a tripeptide, and when  
four do so we have a tetrapeptide, and so on to form resulting structures known as  
oligopeptides. When many amino acid *residues* bond together to form a long  
structure, the result is known as a polypeptide chain, as depicted in Figure 2.9.  
Proteins are formed from one or more polypeptide chains. To be able to perform their  
biological function (e.g., as an enzyme or a structural element such as a  
microfilament) proteins fold into one or more specific spatial conformations dictated  
by the sequence of residues in their polypeptide chains and the corresponding  
permitted values for the rotational angles f and j. Protein sizes range from a lower  
limit of around 50 to several thousand amino acid residues. An average protein  
contains around 300 residues. Very large aggregates can be formed from protein  
subunits, for example many thousand actin molecules assemble into a microfilament.

Primary structure: This is defined by the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide  
chains. A specific gene in a cell determines the primary structure of a protein. As  
will be described later in this chapter, a specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA  
is transcribed into mRNA, which is then read by structures called ribosomes - in a  
process called translation. The sequence of a protein is unique to that protein, and  
defines its structure and function. The primary structure is held together by the  
covalent, peptide bonds, made during the process of protein biosynthesis or  
translation by ribosomes. These peptide bonds provide rigidity to the protein.  
The primary structure can also be defined by the covalent bonding of sulphur  
atoms between two cysteine residues in the same or different polypeptide chains.  
These bonds are termed disulphide bridges, and an example is given in Figure 2.9.

Secondary structure: This refers to the arrangement of parts of a polypeptide  
chain into highly regular sub-structures, the most prominent of which are the alpha  
helix and the beta-pleated sheet structures shown in Figure 2.10. Hydrogen bonds  
are responsible for stabilizing these two structures. The conformations of the  
amino acid residues in the alpha helix correspond to values for $\phi$ of -45o and -50o and  
$\psi$ = -60o, and each turn of the helix includes 3.6 residues. Each residue  
participates in a hydrogen bond, so that each successive helix turn is held in place  
to an adjacent helix turn by three to four hydrogen bonds. The residues in a beta-  
pleated sheet structure have conformations with $\phi$ = -135o and $\psi$ = +135o, and is  
also held together by hydrogen bonds. However, because water-amide hydrogen  
bonds are generally stronger than amide-amide hydrogen bonds, these secondary  
structures are stable only when the local concentration of water is sufficiently low,  
as for example in the fully folded protein state.

Tertiary structure: This is the 3D structure of a single protein molecule, involving  
the spatial arrangement of the secondary structures, including the folding of parts  
of the polypeptide chain between a-helices and b-sheets. As depicted in Figure  
2.11, it describes the completely folded and compacted polypeptide chain.  
Several polypeptide chains can be combined into a single protein molecule  
through ionic interactions (salt bridges) between oppositely charged ionized side-  
chains, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic ‘bonding’ interactions, disulphide bridges  
and intermolecular van der Waals forces between nonpolar groups. As a general  
rule, the hydrophilic (charged and polar) amino acid residues are located on the  
outside of a folded protein, with the hydrophobic residues buried inside the  
polypeptide structure.

Quaternary structure: The forming of a complex of several protein molecules, or  
protein subunits, that function as part of a larger assembly or protein complex is  
referred to as a quaternary structure - an example of which is depicted in Figure  
2.11. A protein may shift between several, reversible, similar structures in  
performing its biological function - either as an enzyme controlling chemical  
reactions or as a structural element.
