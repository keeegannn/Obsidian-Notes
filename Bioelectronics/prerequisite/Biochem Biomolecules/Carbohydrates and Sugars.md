Carbohydrates are composed of carbon atoms and the atoms that form water  
molecules – namely hydrogen and oxygen.

Simple carbohydrates, called  
monosaccharides, have the chemical structure (CH2O)n and are often referred to as  
simple sugars. The number ‘n’ of carbon atoms ranges from 3 to 7 (trioses, tetroses,  
pentoses, hexoses and heptoses).
Hexose is Glucose C$_{6}$H$_{12}$O$_{6}$ when broken it releases free energy can become a ring formation from the aldehyde at C$_{1}$ reacting with the hydroxyl group on C$_{5}$ this reaction can be done between monosaccharides to make disaccharide's, trisaccharide's or oligosaccharides if below 50 and polysaccharides above 50. Polysaccharides can act as energy stores in cells.

Proteins and lipids, known as glycoproteins and glycolipids, have oligosaccharide  
chain attachments and are important building blocks of cytoplasmic membranes. The  
attached oligosaccharide chains increase the water solubility of the proteins and lipids  
and act to orientate them at the interface between the membrane and the surrounding  
aqueous medium.
