Most biological molecules contain only six different atoms, namely carbon,  
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur.

The electron shells of the  
atoms are labeled K, L and M. Each shell is composed of one or more subshells that  
represent the electronic orbitals about the nucleus of the atom. The first shell, K, has  
one subshell called the 1s shell and can accommodate a maximum of two electrons.  
The second shell, L, has two subshells (2s, 2p) that can accommodate a maximum of  
eight electrons, with six in the 2p shell. The third shell, M, has three subshells (3s, 3p,  
3d) and can accommodate a maximum of eighteen electrons, with ten in the 3d shell.

A covalent bond is formed by the sharing of unpaired electrons, one from the outer  
electron shell of each atom, between the nuclei of two atoms. These shared electrons  
then enter an electronic orbital that is common to both atoms, acting to reduce the  
repulsive force between the two positively charged nuclei and to hold them closely  
together. Hydrogen with one unpaired electron forms only one covalent bond, whilst  
carbon with four electrons forms four bonds. An example of this is methane
