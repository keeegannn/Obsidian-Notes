**Acid and Bases** 
Acidic means it can donate H+ ions
Basic or Alkaline means it can accept H+ ions

The dissociation of water into acid and base is an equilibrium process that follows the  
Law of Mass Action, which states that the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to  
the active masses of the reacting substances.

**The Biological Importance of Ph**
The hydrogen ion and hydroxyl ion concentrations are important in biological  
systems because protons are free to move from the H3O+ to associate with and thereby  
neutralize negatively charged groups. Hydroxyl, OH-, ions are also available to  
neutralize positively charged groups. This ability to neutralize is especially important  
in proteins, which as discussed in the 2nd set of Background Notes contain both  
carboxyl (-COOH) and amino (-NH2) side groups.

The isoelectric point
Is a certain Ph where  the net charge of a protein molecule is 0.
The electrical properties of proteins (e.g., electrophoretic  
mobility and electrostatic interactions) are thus determined by the pH of their  
environment.
**The Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**
The generalized expression for the dissociation of an acid into a proton H+ and its  
anion A- is given by HA <-> H+ + A-
strong acids and strong bases fully dissociate 
HA->H+ + A-
other acids and bases a dissociation equilibrium is established

to calculate the Ph of a strong acid use pH = -log(acid) pH of a strong base is found with pH = 14 + log(base) 
weak acids have pKa of greater than or around 1.0
**Buffers**
A buffer must contain an acid [HA] to neutralize added bases, and a base [A-] to  
neutralize added acids. The greatest buffering capacity of such a conjugate acid-base  
pair occurs when the acid [HA] and base [A-] concentrations are both large and equal.  
Referring to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (1.11) we see that this situation  
exists when the pH is equal to the pKa of the acid component of the buffering system  
(since log1 = 0).
The most effective buffer systems are combinations of weak acids and their salts.
