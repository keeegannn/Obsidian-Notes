The electrical mobility μ of an ion is defined as μ = v/E, where v is the terminal speed  
acquired under the influence of an electric field E. To a good approximation we can  
assume that the terminal speed is reached when the accelerating force (Fa = qE) is  
balanced by the Stokes viscous drag force$$ F_{d} = 6\pi \eta r v $$

The electrical mobility of a  proton should therefore be of the same magnitude as Na+ and K+ ions. However,  from the values in Table 1.7 we see that the apparent rate of migration of the H3O+  ion in an electrical field is significantly greater than that exhibited by Na+ and K+  
ions.

As an assessed Assignment you will be asked to use library and internet sources  
to describe how a transport process, known as the [[Grotthuss mechanism]], is considered  
to be responsible for the apparently high mobility of protons in water structures.
