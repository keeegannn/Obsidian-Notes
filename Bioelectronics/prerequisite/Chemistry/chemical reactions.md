Chemical reactions involve the breaking and forming of covalent bonds, which  
in turn entails the flow of electrons. When writing down the course of a chemical  
reaction, curved arrows (known as ‘electron pushing arrows’) are used to symbolize  
the electron flow.

All chemical reactions reach an equilibrium state. When the reactants are first  
brought together they react at a rate determined by their initial concentrations. This  
follows from the Law of Mass Action, which states that the rate of a chemical reaction  
is proportional to the active masses of the reacting substances. We can represent a  
reaction as
The strengths of some chemical bonds

Finally, the stage will be reached where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions  
become equal and the concentrations of the reactants and products do not change with  
time. We say that the reaction has reached chemical equilibrium. The equilibrium  
constant for the reaction is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations of the  
products and reactants. For a simple reaction ![[Pasted image 20240912150217.png]]
