Atoms can be defined by a characteristic ‘size’ known as their van der Waals  
radius. This radius can be determined from investigations of the mechanical  
properties of gases, from X-ray determinations of the atomic spacing between  
unbonded atoms in crystals, and from dielectric and optical experiments

If two non-bonding atoms are brought together they initially show a weak bonding  
interaction, produced by fluctuating electric interactions of the outer electrons of one  
atom with the positive charge of the other atom’s nucleus, and vice versa this can be 
considered as a fluctuating dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms

Van der Waals attractive interactions arise from dipole-dipole interactions  
between two non-bonding atoms. This interaction fluctuates in tune with how the outer  
electrons in each atom distribute themselves in their orbitals. In a covalent bond, where a pair  
of electrons occupy a common (molecular) orbital, the atoms are brought closer together than  
the sum of their van der Waals radii.

The attraction force between the two atoms increases until their separation distance  
begins to get less than twice the sum of their van der Waals radii, at which point the  
two atoms repel each other very strongly. Van der Waals attraction between two  
atoms is weak, but when many atoms are involved, as occurs for two macromolecular  
‘surfaces’ coming into intimate contact, it can become a significant force of attraction.  
For example, van der Waals interactions make an important contribution to the total  
force holding together the stable conformations of large molecules such as proteins.  
When two atoms form a covalent bond, their atomic centers are much closer together  
than the sum of their van der Waals radii. For example, a single-bonded carbon pair  
is separated by 0.15nm, and double-bonded carbons are spaced 0.13 nm apart.
