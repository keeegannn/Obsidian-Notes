Concentrations of substances dissolved in solutions are often given in terms of  
weight/volume (e.g., mg/L, or mg/100 mL - a common clinical unit). These units do  
not depend on knowledge of the molecular structure of the measured substance. For a  
substance with a known molecular structure, one can define a mole of that substance.
