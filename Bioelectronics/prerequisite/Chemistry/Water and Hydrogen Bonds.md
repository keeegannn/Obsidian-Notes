**Water Bonds**
H-O bonds means that water molecules are dipoles that will align to magnetic fields E due to the differences of electronegativity

Liquid water is a dielectric material possessing a relatively large relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of around 80 at room temperature. Water is great for dissolving salts due to coulombic force of attraction of the opposite charges of their constituent ions. This  
force of attraction is inversely proportional to the relative permittivity of the medium  
in which the ions are embedded.
**Hydrogen bonds**
Hydrogen bonds occur in liquid water due to the positively charged hydrogen atom being attracted to negatively charged oxygen atom in a neighbouring molecule. this causes a formation of a weak bond of around 20 kJ/mol compared to the H-O bond of strength of 460kJ/mol

This shows that from one instant to the next the hydrogen bonds can be swapped with the covalent bond. This is known as dissociation or ionizing the water.

The positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) of the hydronium ion attract the  
electronegative, oxygen, ends of the surrounding water molecules to form a stable  
hydrated hydronium ion
