In a covalent bond formed between two identical atoms, such as the C-C bond,  
the bonding electrons are equally shared between the atoms. Such a bond is termed  
nonpolar. Molecules such as Cl2, H2 and F2 are nonpolar, for example. In the  
description of the concentrations of ions in terms of their equivalents of charge  
concentration, we have alluded to the concept that different atoms exhibit different  
tendencies for the sharing of electrons. This tendency can be quantified by their  
electronegativity, using a scale measured from a hypothetical zero to a maximum  
value of 4.0 (close to that possessed by the most electronegative atom, fluorine). The  
electronegativity values of some atoms are listed in Table 1.4.

atoms toward the upper right of the Periodic Table of  
Elements are more electronegative, and those to the lower left are least  
electronegative. From this Table we can judge that carbon disulphide (CS2) has  
almost equal sharing of its electrons when forming its C-S covalent bonds, and so has  
nonpolar bonds. As a guideline, a maximum difference of 0.4~0.5 in  
electronegativity is often used to define the limit for the formation of a nonpolar bond.  
Thus, when we consider the C-Cl bond, we can see that there is an unequal sharing of  
electrons â€“ with electronic charge on average spending more time nearest to the  
chlorine atom (giving it a slightly negative charge d-) and less time near to the carbon  
atom (making it slightly positively charged d+). We say that this bond is a polar  
bond. The H-F bond is particularly polar. Molecules such as NH3 and H2O also  
possess polar bonds, and this lends to them the properties of an electric dipole  
moment. They will tend to align themselves with an externally applied electric field.  
Typically, chemical bonds formed between atoms having an electronegativity  
difference less than 1.6 (but greater than 0.5) are considered to be polar. For larger  
differences we approach the situation where there is complete transfer of an electron  
from the least to the most electronegative atom. This type of bond is termed ionic.  
The guideline here is that when the electronegativity difference is greater than 2.0 the  
bond is considered to be ionic. Common salt (NaCl) is a good example, forming ionic  
crystals held together by the coulombic forces between the positively charged Na+ and  
negatively charged Cl- atoms. KCl and MgCl2 are other examples of an ionic solid.
