Since the molarity of a solution describes the number of individual particles dispersed  
in a given volume of solution, the concept for electrolytes such as sodium chloride is  
more complicated than for non-electrolytes because of ionic dissociation. For  
example, 1 mol of NaCl dissolved in water produces nearly twice as many particles as  
a mole-equivalent weight of glucose, since the salt dissociates into Na+ and Cl-  
whereas glucose retains its single molecule character. Because of electrostatic  
interaction between the positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions) there is a  
statistical probability that at any instant some Na+ will be associated with Cl-. The  
electrolyte therefore behaves as if it were not 100% dissociated. Because the  
electrostatic force between ions decreases with the square of the distance between  
them, the electrolyte will effectively become more dissociated if the solution is more  
dilute. Thus, the activity (i.e., effective free concentration) of an ion depends on its  
tendency to dissociate in solution, as well as on its total concentration
